### Hi, I'm Akshay 👋

I'm a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at, specializing in Data Science. I'm passionate about building and understanding machine learning models from the ground up, with a deep interest in computer vision, NLP and generative AI.

My most recent work has been as a Research Intern at **IIT-Bombay**, where I'm worked on modeling gait dynamics for clinical profiling. 


>I believe the most interesting challenges lie at the intersection of established theory and messy, real-world data. My approach is to rigorously build from first principles, diagnose problems with methodical experimentation, and prioritize creating tools that are not just accurate, but also reproducible and robust.
